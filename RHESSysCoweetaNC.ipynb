    "Once you have built a RHESSys model using RHESSysWorkflows, you are free to run your model manually. However this will not capture information about model runs in your project metadata. If you would like to record your runs in your project metadata, use the **RunModel** command.\n",

RunModel will echo RHESSys console outlet to the screen (if the -v or verbose option is specified as above), and will always save the same output into a file named 'rhessys.out' stored in the output folder for each model run. The output folder will be named based on the value you provide for the '-pre' or output prefix option. Model output is stored in the output directory of the rhessys directory of your project directory.\n",
